We can easily create links with the help of the anchor tag or the A tag.

Here, the A stands for anchor.

Then we add the href attribute.

This points where we want the anchor tag to take us when we click on the link.

Here the href stands for hypertext reference Between the opening and the closing tag of the anchor tag,

we can use text words or images.

Let's look at an example.

Let's create a new file 

And inside this, let's create a simple link for this.

We'll use a anchor tag and I'll just close this.

And inside this we'll simply call this as sample link

Now we want to connect this link to somewhere.

So for that we will use the href.

So here we'll say href is equals to and I'm going to set this to https slash mylink com 

Let's save that.

Now let's copy this path and let's get to the browser.

It's up on a new tab.

Paste it over here and hit enter.

Here we have a simple link.

Now let's try including this link in a paragraph.

And before this anchor tag, I'm going to use a P tag.

And here I'm just going to move this anchor tag inside this.

Okay.

And after this, what we can do is we can write in a simple text.

This is the first obe ive created 

Okay, let's save that.

Now let's try the same thing.

Let's get back to the browser.

Let's hit refresh.

You can see that we have a paragraph that has a link.

You can also wrap the link around an image tag.

Let's try that.

Let's get back to our code.

And here what I'm going to do is after this, I'm going to use a paragraph tag.

I'm going to use a anchor tag.

And if we tab, the header will be added for you.

And inside this we want an IMG tag that is for image.

Now image has an SRC, so the source is going to be I'm going to use a random image.

So I'm going to call this as https

source.unsplash.com/random.

So this will basically generate a random image.

And what we can do next is we can specify the width and height of the image, because if the image is

too large, it will not fit into our browser.

So we'll call this around 250 pixels, but and let's save that.

And now.

Let's open this in the browser.

So now get back to the browser and hit refresh.

You can see that we have an image right now.

It couldn't find that photo, but that's fine.

We still this is an image.

So you can see that we have the save image as option.

So this is an image and when I click on this, it's basically linked to my site.

So if I click on this, it will take me to the prime inspire.com.

So we can create more complex links with more content inside to display.
